Okay, this is how the folders are setup

- doc folder       contains the PL0 Userâ€™s Manual.pdf 
	           and the README.pdf file for instructions 
	           on how to compile the source code
	  
- src folder       contains all the source code  
	           the .h files and .c files along with
	           the makefile and compiler driver and 
	           some of the test cases used to test 
               	   the programs
	  
- For Grader.zip   contains files for the grader which when unzipped contain the 			   following:
		   - README.pdf on how to compile
		   - changelog.txt denoting changes to source code
		   - 8 folders containing expected outputs for the 
		     eight different test cases which we used to test our
		     compiler
